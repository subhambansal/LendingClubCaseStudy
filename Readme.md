## General Information
> Business Problem:
- Apply risk analytics in banking and financial services on data that institution has collected tracked as history of loans.
- Main objective to prevent or define the parameters by which out client can identity a risky customer who most likely to defaults in repayment of loan such that can avoid lending money in order to save money and mitigate credit risk
- We as a data analyst expected here to identify the main driving vaiables using which can identy a defaulter matric form raw data after applying EDA
- To learn and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers for financial  system

> Solution Stratgy: 
Divided analysis in two border catogry (EDA + Analysis)

### Detailed Step
##### Data Cleaning (Removing Null + Missiong Values + Datatype )
##### Univariate Analysis
##### Segemented Univariate Analysis
##### Bivaraiate/Multivariate Analysis
##### Graph plots
##### Results/Conclusion

## Conclusions

- Customer who apply for 36 months term most likely to pay in full so we can avoid customer ask for 60 months 
- Loan applicants who fall under grade G -are mostly going to be non-defaulters even when loan amount reuested is high
- The applicants have annual income between 50K to 150K are more likely to be defauters when thier Loan amount requested is higher than 7K
- Also we can notice that Borrowers whose income in 300K+ are most likely to be non defaulters even though the loan amount requested is higher, adding more value to business
- Applicants whose DTI is lower ranging from [0-8.5] and thier annual income is 500K+ are likely to be defaulted.
- More the annual income but thier DTI ratio is lesser , they are more likely to be defaulters
- Customer asking loan for debt repayment of credit card payemt are most likely to get default
- Loan applicants who has Mortgage property is tend to be defaulter when higher loan amount is requested 
- Customer provided housing loan on a higher interest rate(around 15%) are most likely to be charged off. Generally, if interest rates are higher than usual for a particular purpose of loan, its more likely that, applicant will be a defaulter
Similar trend observed for debt consolidation as well
- Interest rates grows linearly with grade from A to G.
